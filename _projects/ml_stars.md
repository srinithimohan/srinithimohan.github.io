Coded with Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and pandas, this project investigates certain machine learning models that can best be used to predict the type of a star based on certain attributes. The program can also be applied to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, a diagram that is used by astronomers to classify stars. By using existing data to predict possible star types based on just a few characteristics and then plotting them against the existing H-R diagram, astronomers can then use the model to find potential unusual and rare stars without the need to scope out thousands of star data by hand.
