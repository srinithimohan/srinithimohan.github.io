A single-player pong game created using HTML, CSS, and libraries such as p5.js and p5play to make the game interactive, and the graphics were created by yours truly using Pixilart! Compatible with PCs and mobile devices (use the mouse/touch screen to direct the bar as desired). Give it a shot and see if you can reach for the stars.
